            <h3>Not Flag, Not Wind</h3>
            Two monks were arguing about a flag. One said, "The flag is moving." The other said, "The wind is moving." The sixth patriarch, Eno, happened to be passing by. He told them, "Not the wind, not the flag; mind is moving."<br><br>
            <h3>A Monk Is Rejected</h3>
            A monk approached Seppo and made a formal bow. Seppo hit the monk five times with his stick. The monk asked, "Where is my fault?" The Master struck the monk five additional blows and dismissed him with a loud, "Khats!"<br><br>
            <h3>Tipping Over a Water Vase</h3>
            Hyakujo wished to send a monk to open a new monastery. He told his pupils that whoever answered a question most ably would be appointed. Placing a water vase on the ground, he asked, "Who can say what this is without calling its name?" The chief monk said, "No one can call it a tree stump." Isan, the cook monk, tipped over the case with his foot and went out. Hyakujo smiled and said, "The chief monk loses." And Isan became the master of the new monastery.<br><br>
            <h3>Isan Summons Two Official Monks</h3>
            Master Isan sent for the treasurer, but when he appeared, Isan said, "I sent for the treasurer, not you." The treasurer did not know what to say. The Master next sent for the chief monk, but when he came, Isan said, "I sent for the chief monk, not you." The chief monk, also, was dumbfounded.<br><br>
            <h3>A Cup of Tea</h3>
            A professor commuted from Tokyo to Nanin's temple in Kamakura many Sunday mornings to learn Zen. One morning Nanin served him tea. He poured the professor's cup full-and kept on pouring. The professor watched until he could restrain himself no longer. "Sensei!" he protested, "it is overflowing!" Then Master Nanin said, "Like this cup, you are so full of opinions and speculations that there is no room for anything further."<br><br>
            <h3>The Turtle in the Garden</h3>
            A monk saw a turtle in the garden of Daizui's monastery and asked the teacher, "All beings cover their bones with flesh and skin. Why does this being cover its flesh and skin with bones?" Master Daizu took off one of his sandals and covered the turtle with it.<br><br>
            <h3>Manjusri Enters the Gate</h3>
            One day as Mnjusri stood outside the gate, the Buddha called to him, "Manjusri, Manjusri, why do you not enter?" Manjusri replied, "I do not see myself outside. Why enter?"<br><br>
            <h3>The Short Staff</h3>
            Shuzan held out his short staff and said, "If you call this a short staff, you oppose its reality. If you do not call it a short staff, you ignore the fact. Now what do you wish to call this?"<br><br>
            <h3>Bells and Robes</h3>
            Zen Master Unmon said: "The world is vast and wide. Why do you put on your robes at the sound of a bell?"<br><br>
            <h3>Kotei Strikes and Monk</h3>
            A student of Kassai came to visit Kotei and bowed. Kotei immediately struck the monk. The monk said, "I came especially tosee you and paid homage with a bow. Why do you strike me?" Kotei struck the monk again and chased him from the monastery. The monk returned to his teacher, Kassai, and told the story. "Do you understand or not?" asked Kassai. "No, I don't," answered the monk. "Fortunately you do not understand," Kassai said. "If you did, I would be dumbfounded."<br><br>
            <h3>How Do you See You Buddha-nature?</h3>
            A monk asked Seppo, "I understand that a person in the stage of Cravaka sees his Buddha-nature as he sees the moon at night, and a person in the stage of Bodhisattva sees his Buddha-nature as he sees the sun at day. Tell me how you see your own Buddha-nature?" In answer, Seppo struck the monk three times with his stick. The monk went to another teacher, Ganto, and asked the same question. Ganto slapped him three times.<br><br>
            <h3>The Meditation Arm-rest</h3>
            Ryuge asked Master Suibi, "Why did Bodhidharma come west?" Suibi said, "Pass me that meditation arm-rest." No sooner did Ryuge do so than Suibi hit him over the head with it. Ryuge said, "Strike me as you will, that still does not answer my question." Next, Ryuge went to Master Rinzai and asked the same question. Rinzai said, "Please give me that meditation mat." Ryuge handed the rolled-up mat to Rinzai, who promptly struck him with it.<br><br>
            <h3>The Giver Should Be Thankful</h3>
            While Seisetsu was Master of Engakuji Temple Kamakura, Umezu Seibei, a wealthy merchant, donated 500 ryo to build larger monastery quarters. Umezu brought the money in gold to the teacher. Seitsu said, "All right, I will receive it." Umezu was quite dissatisfied with this response. Hi hinted, "In that sack is 500 ryo." "You told me that before," replied Seisetsu. "Even though I am quite wealthy," Umezu continued, "500 ryo is a lot of money." "Do you want me to thank you for it?" asked Seisetsu. "Don't you think you should?" Umezu replied. "Why should I?" inquired Seisetsu. "The giver should be thankful."<br><br>
