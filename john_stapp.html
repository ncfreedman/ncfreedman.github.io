            After receiving his MD and PhD degrees he joined the Air Force at 34 as a flight surgeon and worked on oxygen systems as part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Manhigh" target="_blank">Project Manhigh</a>, overcoming previous limits of high-altitude flight due to decompression sickness. Then studied the limits of acceleration + decceleration that the human body can sustain, making significant contributions to commercial and military safety harnesses. Stapp often tested apparatus himself, riding in one of his decelerator sleds and becoming the fastest human on land in 1954 at a speed of 632 mph. He also looked into human limits of sustaining wind-blasts by flying a fighter jet without a canopy at 570 mph (wow) and performing one of the first high-altitude sky dives. Unsurprisingly, he broke many bones and had instances of retinal bleeds. Said to have authored and made popular the modern form of Murphy's Law "Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong." The guy was a madman.
