        Here's a collection of some of my favorite zen koans.

        <h3>A Monk Is Rejected</h3>
        A monk approached Seppo and made a formal bow. Seppo hit the monk five times with his stick. The monk asked, "Where is my fault?" The Master struck the monk five additional blows and dismissed him with a loud, "Khats!"
        <h3>Not Flag, Not Wind</h3>
        Two monks were arguing about a flag. One said, "The flag is moving." The other said, "The wind is moving." The sixth patriarch, Eno, happened to be passing by. He told them, "Not the wind, not the flag; mind is moving."
