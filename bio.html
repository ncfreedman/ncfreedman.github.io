        I am a MD PhD candidate in the <a href="https://www.mdphd.pitt.edu/" target=”_blank”>University of Pittsburgh & Carnegie Mellon University MSTP</a>. Through combining computational and experimental methods in genomics and systems neuroscience, I hope to discover links between genetic regulation, neural dynamics and psychiatric conditions. My ultimate goals are to design more effective therapies and to contribute to advances in psychiatric precision medicine.<br><br>
        I most recently worked with George Tseng and Colleen McClung on applied Bayesian network learning and causal discovery methods to infer how gene regulatory pathways are altered in schizophrenia.<br><br>
        I am currently learning the anatomy of the extremities and exploring the intersection of control theory and spiking neural network models.
