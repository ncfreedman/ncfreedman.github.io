        I am a MD PhD student in the <a href="https://www.mdphd.pitt.edu/" target=”_blank”>University of Pittsburgh & Carnegie Mellon University MSTP</a> interested in connections between neural dynamics, human cognition and psychiatric disease. I am motivated to develop computational frameworks to better interpret neural signals, understand basic mechanisms of the brain and ultimately yield improved diagnostic methods and interventions in the clinic. Contributing to the design of more effective therapies on the basis of neurocomputational theory is one of my major goals.

        <h3><i>What I'm Currently Up To</i></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Medical School, current topic: Fuel Metabolism</li>
            <li>Running Musical Generations with my good friend and peer Kenta Yamamoto! Our mission is to connect with elderly residents living in nursing homes through live music playing.</li>
            <li>Reading Enquiries by David Hume along with myriad articles on neurocomputation, mathematics and statistics</li>
            <li>Playing and writing music. If you're around Pittsburgh and would like to jam send me a message!</li>

I am a MD PhD student in the <a href="https://www.mdphd.pitt.edu/" target=”_blank”>University of Pittsburgh & Carnegie Mellon University MSTP</a> interests in neural computation, human cognition and psychiatry. Through building mathematical models of neural population dynamics and cognitive processes, I hope to contribute to a better understanding of psychiatric conditions. My ultimate goals are to design more effective therapies and to work towards advances in psychiatric precision medicine.-->


<!-- BLURB 1
I am a MD PhD student in the <a href="https://www.mdphd.pitt.edu/" target=”_blank”>University of Pittsburgh & Carnegie Mellon University MSTP</a>. Through combining computational and experimental methods in genomics and systems neuroscience, I hope to discover links between genetic regulation, neural dynamics and psychiatric conditions. My ultimate goals are to design more effective therapies and to contribute to advances in psychiatric precision medicine.<br><br>
I most recently worked with George Tseng and Colleen McClung on applied Bayesian network learning and causal discovery methods to infer how gene regulatory pathways are altered in schizophrenia.<br><br> -->
